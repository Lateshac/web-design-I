## Identification 
- All students are required to have in their possession an NCC ID card with a current validation sticker while on campus. Your ID card must be presented upon request.

## Attendance
- **Students are expected to attend all class sessions.** Plan on being ontime to every class. **THREE** absences (excused or unexcused) are allowed. Each absence after three will lower your final grade by **one-half letter grade. SIX absences or above will result in failure or withdrawal** (depending on what is earned). **Two** occurrences of lateness count as **ONE** absence. *(A student is considered late if they come in after attendance is taken.)* If a student arrives late, it is the **STUDENT'S RESPONSIBILITY** to make sure they have been marked present in order to receive credit for the class. Leaving class early or coming back late from a class break counts as one late mark. Missing more than 20% of any class will count as a full absence.
- If you miss an exam, quiz, or presentation you will have **ONE WEEK** from the date given to make it up. If you do not schedule the make up within one week or miss the scheduled make-up date **you will receive a grade of 0. 10 points will be deducted** unless a doctor’s note is provided. 
- **Students are responsible for all materials, notes and assignments for any class unattended.**

## Practice & Notes
- **Dedication, Self-Critique, Revision, and Practice are all vital to your success in this course!** Students will need to spend a **minimum of 6–9 hours/week** outside of class to complete projects and practice and learn theory & techniques. 
- **All students are required to maintain notes** on class instruction. These notes must be presented at the end of the semester as part of your grade.

## Assignments
- A full web site and 4 presentations are expected. Assignments will be considered late if they are not handed in at the **start of class** and **will not be accepted if they are not in a Pocket Folder.** (If you cannot attend the class a project is due, you must email the assignment to me for it not to be considered late.) **Projects will not be accepted AFTER ONE CLASS PAST THE DUE DATE.** Late projects will result in a lowered grade: **ONE FULL LETTER GRADE.** Late projects cannot take advantage of re-submission for extra grade points, when offered. Projects are not to be worked on in class unless time has been designated for that purpose. 
- **NOTHING WILL BE ACCEPTED AFTER THE LAST SCHEDULED CLASS.**

## Miscellaneous Dates *(subject to change)*
- The midterm exam is scheduled for **OCTOBER 25th.**

## Classroom Etiquette & Consideration
- It is illegal to record class content, whether audio or video, without the instructor's permission.
- All cell phones, music, and any other potential distractions must be put away and off during class.
- Laptops, Text Messaging, Headphones & Music Players are **NOT** allowed.
- **FOOD and/or DRINK ARE NOT ALLOWED IN THE COMPUTER CLASSROOMS OR LAB.**
- Any student doing nonclass work (such as web browsing, chatrooms, texting, etc.), disrupting the class, or possessing food and/or drink will be asked to leave **AND** marked absent for that day.

## Print Credits
 - All Computer Graphics students are allotted 100 print credits at the start of the semester for printing in the Computer Graphics labs. A student may actually be entitled to more or less credits based upon the individual Computer Graphics courses the student is taking that semester. See the percourse print credit allotment at[http://art.ncc.edu/cgprint](http://art.ncc.edu/cgprint).
- The printers in the labs are for printing Computer Graphics work only. If you believe your course load entitles you to more than the allotted 100 print credits, see Mike Gallo in GC60 with a copy of your course schedule. If you have used all of your print credits and are not entitled to an increase, you will need to find alternate means for printing. **Proof your work before printing and print wisely.**
- A print credit tracker appears at the bottom left of your screen when logged into a Computer Graphics computer.

## Important Note
- Students should keep copies of all artwork created in their NCC classes for possible use in their portfolio. Students are required to
present as many as **forty (40) original pieces** created at NCC for critique in ART 240 Portfolio Workshop. All artwork included in your

## Art Department Policy: Academic Dishonesty
- “Plagiarize: to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one’s own: to use (a created production) without crediting the source-vi: to commit literary theft: present as new and original an idea or product derived from an existing source.” Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, 1990.
- “Dishonesty, such as cheating or plagiarism, or any form of academic dishonesty”... is considered a serious breach of the Student Code of Conduct. The Art Department has therefore established the following disciplinary procedures to deal with academic dishonesty in art classes:
  - A student who submits someone else’s art work, research paper, report or test answers as their own work will receive a grade of F or 0 (zero), without the possibility of making that individual grade up. In addition, the student’s final grade will drop a minimum of one whole letter grade, i.e. from an A to a B, in that course. There also exists the possibility of referral of this serious breach to the Dean of Students for further disciplinary action. 
  - The Art Department will establish a Code of Conduct Committee. This committee will, when called upon, review individual cases of academic dishonesty in art classes. Students and instructors will have the option to address the Committee as needed. Furthermore, the Chairperson of the Art Department shall be notified of the name of any art student who has violated NCC’s Student Code of Conduct by engaging in academic dishonesty in an art class.
  
## Copyright Requirement
- All source material for assignments and designs must be your own original work (you must be the copyright holder). Students may not use any materials or copy designs found on the Internet or elsewhere unless the class as a group is specifically instructed to do so. The only exception is fonts for typography, which should not be your design, but enhance it. Students are encouraged to use any legal copies of fonts in your work. Other items such as presets, custom image brushes, textures, or patterns included in the software used to produce your assignments will not be deemed an allowable exception unless approved by me prior to handing in the assignment. If you think your work warrants exception to the original work only rule, you must present me with a very specific proposal for my approval prior to handing in the assignment and turn in a signed copy of that proposal with your assignment. Submitting assignments using source material or designs that were not created by you without my written consent will be considered plagiarism. Any forms of academic dishonesty such as plagiarism or cheating will result in failing the project or exam without the possibility of doing it over and receiving a one letter grade reduction in your final grade.

## Disabilities
- If you have a physical, psychological, medical, or learning disability that may impact your ability to carry out assigned course work, I urge that you contact the Center for Students with Disabilities(CSD), Building U.(516 5727241). The counselors at CSD will review your concerns and determine reasonable accommodations you are entitled to by the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. All information and documentation of disability remain confidential.

## Rights of Students
- At the first class meeting instructors must indicate the description of the course, its content, requirements, number of papers, projects and tests, cost of supplies, outside of class time commitment, attendance policy in relation to grades, and grading evaluation system.
- Instructors will provide students with an ongoing evaluation and assessment of their performance throughout the semester. Students should receive a letter grade upon completion of each class project and/or report.
- Reminder: At midsemester instructors will meet with students on an individual basis for a detailed assessment of their performance as well as a letter grade which reflects that performance.
- Students who feel that their rights are not respected are encouraged to speak with the Art Department Chairperson.
