## Identification 
- All students are required to have in their possession an NCC ID card with a current validation sticker while on campus. Your ID card must be presented upon request.

## Attendance
- **Students are expected to attend all class sessions.** Plan on being ontime to every class. **THREE** absences (excused or unexcused) are allowed. Each absence after three will lower your final grade by **one-half letter grade. SIX absences or above will result in failure or withdrawal** (depending on what is earned). Two occurrences of lateness count as ONE absence. (A student is considered late if they come in after attendance is taken.) If a student arrives late, it is the STUDENT'S RESPONSIBILITY to make sure they have been marked present in order to receive credit for the class. Leaving class early or coming back late from a class break counts as one late mark. Missing more than 20% of any class will count as a full absence.
