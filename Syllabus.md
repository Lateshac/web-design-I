## Identification 
- All students are required to have in their possession an NCC ID card with a current validation sticker while on campus. Your ID card must be presented upon request.

## Attendance
- **Students are expected to attend all class sessions.** Plan on being ontime to every class. **THREE** absences (excused or unexcused) are allowed. Each absence after three will lower your final grade by **one-half letter grade. SIX absences or above will result in failure or withdrawal** (depending on what is earned). **Two** occurrences of lateness count as **ONE** absence. *(A student is considered late if they come in after attendance is taken.)* If a student arrives late, it is the **STUDENT'S RESPONSIBILITY** to make sure they have been marked present in order to receive credit for the class. Leaving class early or coming back late from a class break counts as one late mark. Missing more than 20% of any class will count as a full absence.
- If you miss an exam, quiz, or presentation you will have **ONE WEEK** from the date given to make it up. If you do not schedule the make up within one week or miss the scheduled make-up date **you will receive a grade of 0. 10 points will be deducted** unless a doctor’s note is provided. 
- **Students are responsible for all materials, notes and assignments for any class unattended.**

## Practice & Notes
- **Dedication, Self-Critique, Revision, and Practice are all vital to your success in this course!** Students will need to spend a **minimum of 6–9 hours/week** outside of class to complete projects and practice and learn theory & techniques. 
- **All students are required to maintain notes** on class instruction. These notes must be presented at the end of the semester as part of your grade.

## Assignments
- A full web site and 4 presentations are expected. Assignments will be considered late if they are not handed in at the **start of class** and **will not be accepted if they are not in a Pocket Folder.** (If you cannot attend the class a project is due, you must email the assignment to me for it not to be considered late.) **Projects will not be accepted AFTER ONE CLASS PAST THE DUE DATE.** Late projects will result in a lowered grade: **ONE FULL LETTER GRADE.** Late projects cannot take advantage of re-submission for extra grade points, when offered. Projects are not to be worked on in class unless time has been designated for that purpose. 
- **NOTHING WILL BE ACCEPTED AFTER THE LAST SCHEDULED CLASS.**
